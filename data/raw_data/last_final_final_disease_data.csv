1.

Antifungal medications which are provided intravenously include amphotericin B and liposomal amphotericin B products ≥ 5mg/kg

2. Surgical debridement: In this method, the doctors will surgically remove the affected tissue to stop the spread of infection to other body parts.

In some cases, the surgical removal of the affected lung lobe or skin tissue has completely cured the infection without needing any other treatment. This is because the infection had not spread and was removed before it worsened.

3. Oral antifungal medications: These medicines work by inhibiting the growth of cell walls in the fungus and eradicating them. It is essential to control the spread of infections to different body parts. Initially, the patient is provided with antifungal medications intravenously, but once the infection is in control, they are switched to oral antifungal medications. Examples of oral antifungal medications include posaconazole and isavuconazole

However, people suffering from thalassemia major may experience a wide range of symptoms. The severity of the symptoms may also vary and depend on the type of thalassemia.  Some of the common signs and symptoms of thalassemia include:, Another common symptom of thalassemia is weak bones. An increase in the amount of iron in the body may reduce or interfere with the absorption of calcium and Vitamin D. This may lead to weak and brittle bones over time., It is caused as the hemoglobin cannot carry enough oxygen to various parts of the body. The muscles do not receive enough oxygen and reduce the amount of energy produced by the body., In people with thalassemia, there may be an increase in the breakdown of red blood cells in the body. This may lead to an excess release of bilirubin from the cells, which may cause your urine to become darker., Anemia can cause the growth of a child to slow down. Puberty may also be delayed in children with thalassemia., Some people with thalassemia may have extremely pale or yellowish skin as this condition reduces red blood cells in the body., People with thalassemia can get an overload of iron in their bodies, either from the disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions. Too much iron can result in damage to the heart, liver, and endocrine system, which includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout the body. The damage is characterized by excessive deposits of iron. Without adequate iron chelation therapy, almost all patients with beta-thalassemia accumulate potentially fatal iron levels., The spleen aids in fighting infection and filters unwanted material such as old or damaged blood cells. Thalassemia is often accompanied by the destruction of a large number of red blood cells and the task of removing these cells causes the spleen to enlarge. Splenomegaly can make anemia worse, and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells. Severe enlargement of the spleen may necessitate its removal., In some cases, thalassemia may lead to an expansion in the bones, which in turn may cause the bones in your face to widen., People with thalassemia have an increased risk of infection. This is especially true if the spleen has been removed.","People who have thalassemia minor and show mild symptoms may not require any treatment.

Hand","Gout generally causes severe pain in the joint of the big toe, but the attack can occur in other joints as well, like the knee, ankle, foot, wrist, hand, and elbow or even fingers.  This pain is caused due to high uric acid in the joints, which can go out to the space between the bones and end up running against the soft lining of the joints, causing unbearable inflammation. This scenario is referred to as a gout attack. The pain is at peak within the first 4 to 12 hours of the attack and generally occurs either early morning or after midnight., The area affected by gout swells up and becomes red with a feeling of tenderness, making it extremely sensitive to any sort of touch or weight over it. In cases of severe gout attacks, high uric acid can also turn the affected area purple in color., An attack of gout generally happens overnight, which is so sharp and sudden that it often wakes up the affected person in the middle of the night with a burning sensation in the affected area.  Acute gout attacks can last for somewhere between 3 and 10 days, and if you do not get the uric acid treatment in time, it can become chronic, causing permanent damage to your joints.  Some of the common symptoms and signs of high uric acid include:, As the gout attack becomes more frequent over one joint, high amounts of uric acid crystals get deposited in the joints. This reduces the ease of movement or the comfort of movement, which can also get converted into abnormal movement of the joints. This is one of the common high uric acid symptoms of chronic gout., Even after the episode of the gout attack, the joint discomfort can last for days or weeks, but the pain gets subsidized. However, any gout attack in the future on the same joint generally lasts longer, causing sharper pain. Such later gout attacks can also affect other joints which were not affected in the previous strikes., The presence of high uric acid can lead to crystallization of the compound in the affected joint, resulting in the formation of small and firm lumps called tophi. These visibly large urate crystals are white and generally form near the toes, knees, elbow, fingers, wrist, or ears. Tophi, which generally occurs in the case of chronic tophaceous gout, can get swollen up to the point of a breakdown or burst and leak a pus-like fluid.   The fluid generally does not cause any pain but can prevent the affected person from doing normal activities on a day-to-day basis. In some cases, tophi can also potentially damage the cartilage and bone, leading to extreme pain while using the joint for routine activities.  In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, another one of the common symptoms of gout in the ankle includes shiny and flushed skin. This is one of the externally visible symptoms, which can help you with gout’s early detection.
